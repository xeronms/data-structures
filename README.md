# dynamic stack

My stack template implementation with dynamic memory allocation.

While creating the stack have to be declared a maximum size of that.

I doesn't really matter how big the max size is because of dynamic memory allocation which takes place after pushing declared amout of elements (LIMIT_N) 

After every amount of LIMIT_N elements added, the memory of the stack is extended by another LIMIT_N of elements.

# singly and doubly linked list

Two list templates, doubly linked list inherits from singly linked and adds needed changes in code.

# binary tree

Implementation of a binary tree yet not finished completely.
